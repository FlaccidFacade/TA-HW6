# TA-HW5

Create a C/C++ program that will create a multi-threaded server socket program.  This program should accept a minimal (any) HTTP request from a web browser (your choice) and after a few second delay  return a "Hello World" message to be displayed by the web browser client.  You should test that your threads work by running a few browsers.  You may have only a thread pool (threads only created at the start of the program) of 2 threads available to be run at any time.
